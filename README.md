### INSTRUCTIONS
* Watch given screen capture mp4 to see how page reacts to different screen sizes and animates.
* Use **ANY** js or css libraries you prefer to complete. Pre-included libraries are:
    * jQuery
    * TweenMax
    * AnimateCSS
* Use any pre-processors (SASS, Typescript, Pug, etc) you prefer to complete.
* Using latest technologies that work across all modern browsers is encouraged but not required.
* Use either pre-laid out projects on [CodePen][1] or [JSFiddle][2] click "Fork" then save the finished link address.

## CSS INSTRUCTION
### SCREEN SIZE:

  mobile break point = **768px**
  

### COLOR:

* "red" border and background
* "blue" border and background
* border and `.inner-block` opacity is 50%
* `.block` background opacity is 10%

## JS/CSS SIZING INSTRUCTION:

**screen must always have a 20px padding on every side.**

### DESKTOP VIEW:

* `.block`(s) must remain centered to y coordinate.
* `.block`(s) border is **5px**.
* `.block`(s) must stay square while screen width is at least **0.5x** the size of the height.
* if height is smaller than **0.5x** the screen's width, the `.block`(s) must fluidly scale the height while the width remains the same.
* `.block`(s) must stay **20px** apart while in desktop view.
* `.inside-block` must remain centered inside `.block`

### MOBILE VIEW:

* `.block`(s) must remain centered to y coordinate.
* `.block`(s) must overlap (this will create a "purple" color).
* `.block`(s) must stay square while screen width is larger than the size of the height.
* if height is smaller than screen's width, the `.block`(s) must fluidly scale the height while the width remains the same.
* `.inside-block` must remain centered inside `.block`

## EXTRA CREDIT:

* have `.block` resizing ease into place as screen size changes.
* have `.inside-block` random switch width and height every second. Calculated height and width must be  > 50px and < 200px
